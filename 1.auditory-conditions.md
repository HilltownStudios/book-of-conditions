# Auditory Conditions
Auditory conditions are those conditions that affect the sense of hearing, including the nerves, organs, and auditory cortex.

## Overview
This is a listing of conditions that affect the sense of hearing and the brain's capacity to process sounds.

## Game Applications
These conditions apply to any situation requiring the use of the sense of hearing, such as detecting approaching enemies or other hazards by sound, evaluating anything with a sound component, navigating by sound, picking out conversation from background noise, etc. Auditory conditions can be temporary or permanent, and for creatures with two ears, they can be unilateral (affecting only one ear) or bilateral (affecting both ears). Creatures with more than two ears could have multilateral anacusis; creatures with no auditory senses are presumed to be immune to these conditions. The player and the DM are advised to work out the particular situational applications according to the specified condition.

## Mitigators
Auditory conditions and their related effects can be mitigated or moderated via magical or mechanical means, including spells and item effects that either remove the condition or provide long or short-term workarounds. Sign languages, lip reading, ear plugs, and external hearing aids are all non-magical mitigators or communication alternatives. A heightened ability to sense vibrations can serve as a partial replacement for hearing acuity.

## Conditions
### Anacusis
* An anacusic creature is unable to hear with one or more of its ears and automatically fails any check that requires hearing with the affected ear(s). 
* Creatures with bilateral/complete anacusis are immune to spells, effects, and environments that require the target to hear them or otherwise affect the creatures via the sense of hearing.
* Creatures with unilateral/partial anacusis are resistant to sound-based spells, effects, and environments and have advantage on checks against spells, effects, and environments that require the target to hear them or otherwise affect the creatures via the sense of hearing.
* Anacusic creatures may be unable to speak or have trouble being understood via verbal communication, and have difficulty learning new spoken languages.

### Hypoacusis
* A hypoacusic creature has partial hearing loss in one or more of its ears and has disadvantage on any check that requires hearing with the affected ear(s).
* Hypoacusic creatures are resistant to sound-based spells, effects, and environments and have advantage on checks against spells, effects, and environments that require the target to hear them or otherwise affect the creatures via the sense of hearing.
* Hypoacusic creatures may have noticeable speech impediments or speak louder than necessary.

### Hyperacusis
* A hyperacusic creature has an enhanced auditory acuity for some or all sounds, in one or more of its ears, and has advantage on any check that requires hearing with the affected ear(s).
* A hyperacusic creature is more susceptible to sound-based spells, effects, and environments and has disadvantage on hecks against spells, effects, and environments that require the target to hear them or otherwise affect the creatures via the sense of hearing.
* Hyperacusic creatures may speak softly, avoid crowds, and generally prefer solitude.
