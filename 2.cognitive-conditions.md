# Cognitive Conditions
Cognitive conditions are those conditions specifically affecting cognition, including memory, learning, concentration, and decision-making.

## Overview
This is a listing of conditions that affect memory, learning, concentration and decision-making.

## Game Applications
These conditions apply to any situation requiring the use of cognition, such as remembering learned information, memorizing and recalling spells, learning new things, maintaining concentration, and making decisions. Cognitive conditions can be temporary or permanent, and for creatures with distributed brains, limited to the affected areas. This is a broad area that can't be encapsulated simply within one or two ability scores. As such, the player and the DM are advised to work out the particular nature of the cognitive conditions and their contextual applications.

## Mitigators
Cognitive conditions and their related effects can be mitigated or moderated via magical means including spell and item effects that either remove the condition or provide short-term workarounds; by therapeutic means such as physical aids, reminders, etc.; by (non-magical) pharmaceutical means; or by use of personal attendants or aids.
