# Visual Conditions

## Overview
This is a listing of various conditions that affect some portion of a creature's visual system. These include color sense, light sense, peripheral vision, and visual acuity. As a complicated system, the list of visual conditions is commensurately large (though I make no representation about its comprehensiveness). In many cases, the condition can affect one or both eyes (or more if the creature has more eyes); it is recommended that the player and DM come to an agreement on the scope of the challenges and opportunities that follow from the conditions, and the circumstances under which they become important in game play.

## Mitigators
Creatures with visual conditions that provide challenges or limitations can sometimes work around these or mitigate them with magic, assistive devices (such as corrective lenses), other senses (such as the sense of touch or the sense of hearing), or the use of trained animal companions. 
## Conditions
### Color Sense
#### Achromatopsia
##### When trying to accomplish something:
* An achromatopsic creature can’t distinguish any colors from gray and automatically fails any ability check that involves distinguishing color.
##### When trying to avoid a harmful spell or effect:
* An achromatopsic creature is resistant to spells and effects that rely on rapid color changes or other color-based trickery and has advantage on any ability check that involves distinguishing color.
#### Hypochromatopsia
##### When trying to accomplish something:
* A hypochromatopsic creature has trouble distinguishing between notable color pairs (generally red/green or yellow/blue) and has disadvantage on any ability check that involves distinguishing between the affected color pairs.
##### When trying to avoid a harmful spell or effect:
* A hypochromatopsic creature may be resistant to spells and effects that rely on rapid color changes or other color-based trickery involving the affected color pairs and has advantage on any ability check that involves distinguishing between the affected color pairs.
#### Hyperchromatopsia
##### When trying to accomplish something:
* A hyperchromatopsic creature can distinguish between even subtle shades of the same color and has advantage on any ability check that requires distinguishing color.
##### When trying to avoid a harmful spell or effect:
* A hyperchromatopsic creature is particularly susceptible to spells and effects that rely on rapid color changes or other color-based trickery and has disadvantage on any ability check that involves distinguishing color.
### Light Sense
#### Askotopia
* An askotopic creature has lost all of its darkvision and is blinded in both darkness and dim light.
#### Hyposkotopia
* A hyposkotopic creature has a diminished sense of sight in low-light conditions, is blinded in darkness, and loses its color perception in dim light.
#### Hyperskotopia
* A hyperskotopic creature has low-light vision.
#### Superskotopia
* A superskotopic creature has darkvision.
#### Photophobia
* A photophobic creature has an intolerance to sources of light (e.g., daylight, bright light, artificial light, etc.) and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while exposed to a source of light to which it has a sensitivity.
### Peripheral Vision
#### Visual Aperipheria
* An visually aperipheric creature can’t see objects that are in its periphery and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight if the target is not directly in front of it.
#### Visual Hypoperipheria
* A visually hypoperipheric creature has trouble seeing objects that are in its visual periphery and has disadvantage on any ability check that requires sight if the target is not directly in front of it.
### Visual Acuity
#### Myopia
* A myopic creature can’t focus on objects that are far away and has disadvantage on any attack roll or ability check that requires sight if the target is more than 5 feet away.
#### Hyperopia
* A hyperopic creature can’t focus on objects that are nearby and has disadvantage on any attack roll or ability check that requires sight if the target is within 5 feet.
#### Visual Hyperacuity
* A visually hyperacute creature has an enhanced ability to discern fine visual detail and has advantage on ability checks that require distinguishing fine visual detail.
