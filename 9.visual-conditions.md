## Conditions
### Color Sense
#### Achromatopsia
* An achromatopsic creature can’t distinguish any colors from gray and automatically fails any ability check that requires distinguishing color.
#### Hypochromatopsia
* A hypochromatopsic creature has trouble distinguishing between notable color pairs (red/green or yellow/blue) and has disadvantage on any ability check that requires distinguishing color when the target is in the affected color range.
#### Hyperchromatopsia
* A hyperchromatopsic creature can distinguish between even subtle shades of the same color and has advantage on any ability check that requires distinguishing color.
### Light Sense
#### Askotopia
* An askotopic creature has lost all of its darkvision and is blinded in both darkness and dim light.
#### Hyposkotopia
* A hyposkotopic creature has a diminished sense of sight in low-light conditions, is blinded in darkness, and loses its color perception in dim light.
#### Hyperskotopia
* A hyperskotopic creature has low-light vision.
#### Superskotopia
* A superskotopic creature has darkvision
### Peripheral Vision
#### Visual Aperipheria
* An visually aperipheric creature can’t see objects that are in its periphery and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight if the target is not directly in front of it.
#### Visual Hypoperipheria
* A visually hypoperipheric creature has trouble seeing objects that are in its visual periphery and has disadvantage on any ability check that requires sight if the target is not directly in front of it.
### Visual Acuity
#### Myopia
* A myopic creature can’t focus on objects that are far away and has disadvantage on any attack roll or ability check that requires sight if the target is more than 5 feet away.
#### Hyperopia
* A hyperopic creature can’t focus on objects that are nearby and has disadvantage on any attack roll or ability check that requires sight if the target is within 5 feet.
