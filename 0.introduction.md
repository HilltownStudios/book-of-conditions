# 0. Introduction
As I was combing through another deep-dive D&D reference work of mine, the [Toxinomicon](https://github.com/HilltownStudios/toxinomicon), it occurred to me that the Conditions in the core rules were very general. While I understand and even applaud the reasons behind this, I still felt that the D&D community could benefit from a more expansive view of the various conditions to which a human (and elven, dwarven, etc.) body could be subjected. Now, with some rare exceptions, the Conditions listed in the core rulebooks are impairments of some sort or other. That is, except for Invisible, they all impose some limits on player characters’ ability to perform the actions they want or need to perform, whether its highly context-specific disadvantage on an ability check, or the automatic failure of such an ability check. As written, they provide a great number of options for a standard campaign or session, but they leave any sense of specificity to the imagination and understanding of the players and the dungeon master.

This guide, then, is an attempt to expand on the very general Conditions and expand them with greater specificity by looking at both impairment and augmentation within these Conditions as possible categories. Not every Condition has a set of more specific impairments that apply, but many do. It is my hope that this guide sparks new roleplaying opportunities. After writing a good portion of it, I also realized that it could serve as a means of increasing awareness of disabilities, and while I am certain I will make some omissions, the idea here is to be as comprehensive as possible. One additional potential side-effect is that a comprehensive list of impairments with a map to in-game mechanics can provide greater depth in character creation options, and maybe even increase character representation at game tables of people with disabilities.

For simplicity, I am grouping anything that is an augmentation or some heightened sense with its related impairments. This is because such augmentations, especially when they occur in non-RPG settings, tend to share naming characteristics. Additionally, I think it’s better to model the spectrum of a particular set of conditions, from disability to superability, as continuously as possible. The most complete example of this is darkvision, which in a non-D&D human would be a superability; a related impairment is lowered sensitivity to light and therefore inability to see at all in darkness and dim light. Both of these together represent a contextual blindness/sightedness along a natural and supernatural spectrum.

The approach I have taken with respect to these conditions is to examine them from a primarily functional aspect. That is, rather than try to model the range of clinical diagnoses that are at the heart of each condition, I am looking instead at the effect on in-game ability. This, of course, means that no specific clinical diagnoses will appear in the condition names and descriptions, but on the other hand, if this guide covers the functional conditions as exhaustively as I hope, all of the clinical diagnoses can be abstracted from them by those with more knowledge. In any case, it seems foolish to me to try to bundle a set of functional conditions as representative of one or more clinical conditions, when the truth is many clinical diagnoses exist along a spectrum. As a parent of a child on the autism spectrum, and as someone who for that reason knows others on the spectrum, the topic of functional vs clinical condition is one where I can appreciate the need for nuance. 

And finally, as I always suggest in the materials I write, feedback is welcome. I recognize that I will miss something, perhaps something important, and that I am not an expert in any of the things I am writing here. Therefore feedback from those who know more is incredibly valuable.
